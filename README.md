As a Data Scientist at ID/X Partners, I will be involved in a project from a lending company (multifinance), where my client wants to improve the accuracy of assessing and managing credit risk, so that they can optimize their business decisions and reduce potential losses.

My task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict credit risk based on the provided dataset, which includes approved and rejected loan data. In developing the model, I need to carry out several stages starting with Data Understanding, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Machine Learning Modeling, and Evaluation.
